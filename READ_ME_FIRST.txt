  WHY YOUR PROJECT ISN'T ON GITHUB YET - SIMPLE EXPLANATION
================================================================================

QUESTION: "Why isn't my project pushed to GitHub?"

ANSWER: Your project files are ONLY on your computer right now!
        They haven't been uploaded to GitHub yet.

================================================================================
  WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
================================================================================

Your files are here:  C:\Users\sss\Desktop\hacathon-1
They need to be here: https://github.com/Atkh0405/physical-ai-robotics-textbook

To move them from your computer to GitHub, you need to UPLOAD them.

The automated scripts (deploy.bat) can't run because Git is not installed
on your computer.

================================================================================
  WHAT'S BEEN DONE?
================================================================================

✅ All project files created (10 chapters, AI assistant, animations)
✅ Deployment configuration files ready
✅ Multiple guides created for you
✅ Server running on http://localhost:8000

❌ Files NOT uploaded to GitHub yet (this is what you need to do!)
❌ Not deployed to Vercel yet (do this after GitHub upload)
